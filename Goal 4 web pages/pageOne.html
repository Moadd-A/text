                <p>
                  The role of computing has a pivotal place in the future of
                  education, and if used resourcefully, has the ability to overcome
                  the traditional barriers of teaching and transform education. To
                  ensure inclusive, equitable, high-quality education, and to promote
                  lifelong educational opportunities for all, a breakthrough in
                  education is a necessity. UN sustainability goal 4 will require the
                  aid of technology-enhanced learning (Lytras, Sarirete and Damiani,
                  2020) which highlights the application of Online Learning platforms.
                  Online learning platforms serve as a transformative force that
                  provide a way to further diversify the learning experience in a
                  classroom setting. This is done by leveraging technological
                  advancements that are equipped with interactivity, instant
                  accessibility to endless teaching content, and adaptive learning
                  capabilities. These various qualities further show the potential of
                  eLearning and its capability to heighten student engagement
                  (Abuhassna, et al., 2020), promoting continuous skill acquisition
                  and development. Additionally, this will empower individuals
                  internationally to engage in lifelong learning, which is a core
                  principle of goal 4. The United Nations has planned ten main targets
                  for Goal 4, to be achieved by 2030. These are overarching goals
                  confirming that education will be inclusive, fair, high quality and
                  lifelong. Moreover, these goals can be attainable by the use of
                  computing and advanced technological resources.

          <p>
            The inherent cost-efficiency of eLearning contributes to the need for
            inclusivity by making education more affordable and accessible. A
            compelling case from the University System of Georgia (USG) introduces an
            initiative that will, “Create a suite of online bachelor’s degrees by
            building on the success of USG’s eCore”, (Board of Regents of the
            University System of Georgia, 2013) an online core curriculum used as one
            of the paths for further educational services. The USG reveals compelling
            figures: 
              
           <p id="quote"> “USG estimates that in five years, the new program can achieve a
            per-student instructional cost of $5,000, a little over half the current
            $9,700 average at USG campuses. Correspondingly, student fees will be
            about 25% lower.”</p>
            
            These findings are indicative of the cost-efficiency of
            online learning platforms. These statistics themselves, in their excesses
            and the huge golf between them, indicate the vast monetary difference
            between a traditional approach to learning and its technology-assisted
            counterpart. If the cost variance is this large currently, picture the
            potential cost difference when systems like this are fully optimised and
            developed. It is now time to take advantage of the endless potential of
            eLearning to open educational excellence to all globally and make
            sufficient progress towards the UN’s sustainability goal 4 with the aid of
            technology.
