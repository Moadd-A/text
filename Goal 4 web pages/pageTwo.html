              <p>
                Equitable quality education means that all individuals have a fair opportunity to a high-quality education. To achieve this, robust systems must be implemented to ensure individuals are receiving identical treatment throughout the course of their education. One method, is through eLearning platforms curating personalised learning environments through the means of learning management systems (LMS) (Shurygin et al., 2021)<a href="references.html#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. The use of highly advanced eLearning models such as LMS. An example of an innovative online platform created with the use of LMS are the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are an example of how education can be fairly distributed (Waks, 2016)<a href="references.html#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. By example in 2014, when the first online masterâ€™s degree was developed using the MOOC model (Goodman, Melkers and Pallais, 2016)<a href="references.html#ref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and it was labelled an equivalent qualification to the traditional on-campus course. The key differences between the two are the diversity to the approach of online learning in comparison to the traditional in-person pen-and-paper approach and also the great cost difference (one sixth less). This illustrates that eLearning can lead to a just as valuable degree as its traditional equivalent. Furthermore, a report published recently has reviewed online learning platforms such as MOOCs (Papadakis, 2023)<a href="references.html#ref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> in of refugee camps within developing countries: Kenya, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. A multitude of opportunities were presented to those who could not access any educational facilities including courses in engineering, IT, and social sciences. This innovative online learning platform has been utilised by prestigious universities and individuals in low-income countries. Not only have online platforms elevated education but also increased the accessibility to all whilst remaining in line with goal 4 set out by the UN.

                The UN states that 84 million children and youth will be without schooling by 2030, and 300 million students will lack basic numeracy and literacy skills (United Nations, 2023)<a href="references.html#ref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. A cornerstone for discussion to overcome these projected statistics should be the use of open education resources (OER). OER, are materials created with the intention for everyone to use for their personal education and are designed to give everyone the chance to achieve an ability for lifelong learning. Future Learn is an excellent example of what technology is capable of. It was developed by a British company and offers access to high-quality courses such those for business and management.

                Making a platform with beneficial resources and providing access to them will equip students with the correct educational devices (Harsasi, 2015)<a href="references.html#ref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> for life. Furthermore, the maintenance for OERs is low and its media-rich materials can be available indefinitely and accessed anywhere. When made correctly, they provide limitless open resources that are always widely accessible; these forms of education are high quality and inclusive to all. E-learning and lifelong learning are inherently complementary, as the wealth of knowledge and skills available on these online platforms tend to persist, therefore lifelong learning is definite when the utilisation of computational technologies is appropriately employed.
