             <h1>How we can achieve equitable and high-quality education:</h1>   
              <p>
                Equitable quality education means that all individuals have a fair opportunity to receive a high-quality education. To achieve this, robust systems must be implemented to ensure all individuals are receiving identical treatment throughout the course of their education. eLearning platforms curate personalised learning environments with the help of learning management systems (LMS) (Shurygin et al., 2021). The use of highly advanced eLearning models such as LMS allows for the distribution of a high standard of education, assisted by innovative platforms as the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are an example of how education can be fairly distributed (Waks, 2016). In 2014, the first online master’s degree was made using the MOOC model (Goodman, Melkers and Pallais, 2016) and was labelled as an equivalent qualification to the traditional on-campus course. The differences between the two, besides the way teaching is administered, are that the online master’s qualification exploits the effectiveness of online learning platforms and costs a sixth less than the in-person degree. This means that eLearning can be just as qualification-bearing as its traditional equivalent. Furthermore, a report published recently has reviewed the use of online learning platforms such as MOOCs (Papadakis, 2023) in developing countries inside of refugee camps in Kenya, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. A multitude of opportunities were presented to those who could not access any education facilities, including courses in engineering, IT, and social sciences. This innovative online learning platform has been utilised by prestigious universities and by individuals in low-income countries. This raises the question: why haven’t technologies as innovative and advanced as these applied to the progress of Goal 4?

        <p>How we can promote lifelong learning:
          The UN states that 84 million children and youth will be out of school by 2030, and 300 million students will lack basic numeracy and literacy skills. A cornerstone for discussion to overcome these projected statistics should be the use of open education resources (OER). Open education resources are materials created with the intention for everyone to use for their personal education and are designed to give everyone the chance to achieve an ability for lifelong learning. Making a platform with beneficial resources and providing access to them will equip students with the correct educational devices (Harsasi, 2015) for life. The maintenance for OERs is low, and media-rich materials can be kept up indefinitely and accessed anywhere. When made correctly, they provide an endless number of open resources that are always widely accessible; these forms of education are high quality and inclusive of all. E-learning and lifelong learning are inherently complementary, as the wealth of knowledge and skills available on these online platforms tend to persist indefinitely, and so lifelong learning is definite when the utilisation of computational technologies is appropriately employed.
          
          As we all continue to witness with wonder the evolution within this industry, the United Nations will need to take leadership to employ these technological benefits to advance and enhance teaching for the world and soon-to-be tech-savvy generation.</p>
